The solution to the problem was quite simple: checking the monitor's frequency. At 144 Hz, the video card shows 100% Memory Clock in [radeontop](https://github.com/clbr/radeontop).

> Command that shows your GPU utilization, both for the total activity percent and individual blocks.
> 
> Install for arch-based distros: `sudo pacman -S radeontop`

Lowering the frequency to 60Hz brings everything back to normal.

Another issue is that the fans of the video card may not spin. This can lead to the video card overheating and failing. Without manual temperature monitoring, you might not realize the card is overheating until it's too late.

The `amdgpu-fan` utility can help to solve this problem.

For arch-based distros, the sequence of actions will be as follows:

```shell
yay -S amdgpu-fan

sudo systemctl enable amdgpu-fan

sudo systemctl start amdgpu-fan
```

The settings are in the file `/etc/amdgpu-fan.yml`. If the defaults don't satisfy you, you can configure the cooling scheme yourself.

With this setup, the fans will start spinning when the video card is under load.
