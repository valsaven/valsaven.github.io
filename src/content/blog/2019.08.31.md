## YubiKey 5 NFC: A Hardware Key.

What's new in the 5th model?
It now supports FIDO2 and, directly, NFC.

## Delivery

YubiKey does not ship their products to China, Afghanistan, Russia, Ukraine, North Korea, Iran, Sudan, and Syria, so alternative methods must be sought.

I received my key by ordering it to a hostel address in Britain, where I was at the time. I think various forwarding services can handle this too.

## Cost

One key cost me $62.50 ($45 for the key, $5 for shipping, $12.50 in taxes).

You can order 1, 2, 10, or 50 pieces. A discount appears on orders of 10 or more (though it's quite modest).

## Applications

There is a Yubico Authenticator app available for the following platforms: Windows, Linux, Mac, Android, iOS.
